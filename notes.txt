game modes:

- Game 1: press as much as possible
- Game 2: ping pong (x seconds time to press)
- first to press x times wins
- estimate 30 seconds
- pass "bomb" around





todo:

- big button should already be on if there are already player slected (from last game)
- same if already the previous game is pre selected

- check bounce time? (button events seem to get triggered multiple times)
    - maybe increase bounce time of big button only?
