game modes:

- Game 1: press as much as possible
- Game 2: ping pong (x seconds time to press)
- first to press x times wins
- estimate 30 seconds
- pass "bomb" around





todo:


- check bounce time? (button events seem to get triggered multiple times)
    - maybe increase bounce time of big button only?

- add a cleanup script to disable all buttons when game is ending/stopped
